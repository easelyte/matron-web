title: "Web journal client — subagent sub-chat rendering"
status: draft
date: 2026-07-18
loop: 453
owner: easelyte
approach: "A — full apple/iOS parity minus split-view"
rejected_alternatives:
  - "B (A + desktop split-view): the one real gain — watching parent + child stream simultaneously — is largely nullified by the dominant execution pattern (when a subagent runs, the parent is blocked on the Task tool and produces nothing; by the time the parent resumes, the child is done). Split-view is where ~60% of the work lives (forcing the single-selected-convo store to hold two live convos: events/streams/status/activity keyed by convo_id + a second `viewing` subscription). Deferred to a follow-up loop if parallel-subagent monitoring proves valuable."
  - "C (B + inline tappable subtask markers in the parent timeline): not wire-supported. The bridge publishes the parent's spawn marker as a plain `type:'text'` event `🔀 Subtask: <desc>` carrying no child convo id and no Task `tool_use_id` (index.js:2889 → 4036). There is no correlation key in the parent timeline to anchor a tappable link. Requires a bridge change (cross-repo, serialized separately) + an upstream proposal to Matronhq. Out of scope; file as follow-up."
related_principles:
  - "P2 Canonical Source of Truth — parent_convo_id has one authoritative source (server); client derives children from it, no sync"
  - "P5 / P31 Don't mirror external state — scroll follow-state reads the DOM scroll position, cached minimally, not a full React mirror of the scroll machine"
  - "P13 Global CSS platform interactions — throttle the new scroll handler with rAF; targeted scrollIntoView not global smooth-scroll"
  - "P23 Explicit state machines for async UI — tail-follow is a small explicit state (following / not-following) not a tangle of booleans"
  - "P35 Code-coordinate citations grep-confirmed at write time — all file:line refs below verified against HEAD ccca0fd"
constraint: "components.tsx (1874) and client.ts (1395) must NOT be split — matron-web stays structurally aligned with Matronhq/matron-web upstream (memory: project_matron_web_stays_dan_upstream_aligned). All new components/state land INLINE in the existing files."

# Web journal client — subagent sub-chat rendering

## 1. Problem & goal

The matron-web journal client renders subagent child-conversations as **flat, top-level sibling rows** in the conversation list — indistinguishable from root conversations, with no way to see which subagents a session spawned or to follow one while it runs. This is the biggest remaining apple-parity gap (loop #453).

The data to fix it already flows end-to-end (bridge #141 + journal server), but the web client has **zero** `parent_convo_id` handling. The goal is to reach parity with the apple client's iOS surface: children are grouped under their parent, hidden from the main list, and reachable through a running-subagent strip + a header switcher + a read-only child viewer, with proper tail-follow and a jump-to-bottom control.

**Parity target = apple iOS behavior** (push-navigation model). The apple Mac split-view is explicitly a non-goal for this iteration (see rejected alternative B).

## 2. What already works (no server/bridge change needed)

Verified against the journal server (`/opt/matron/journal`, Node) and the bridge (`/opt/matron/bridge-journal`, journal-deploy):

- **Snapshot payload** — every convo in `GET /snapshot` carries `parent_convo_id` (`journal.js:139-144`). NULL for normal convos; set for children.
- **Live `convo_meta` event** — emitted on child creation/title change with `payload: { title, parent_convo_id }` (`ws.js:557-562`). The bridge forces this even titleless so a live client links the child immediately rather than waiting for the next snapshot.
- **`session_state`** on each convo = `"running"` | `"done"` — drives the running/finished distinction.
- **Server already treats children as silent** — no unread badge bump, no push, read-marker recompute skips them (`journal.js:109-117, 193`; `push.js:160-167`). The client mirrors this defensively but does not depend on it.
- **Linkage is child→parent only** (structural). The parent timeline's `🔀 Subtask` line is cosmetic text with no child id — which is exactly why inline tappable markers (alternative C) are out of scope.

**Child convo id convention:** `<parentConvoId>:sub:<agentId>` (bridge `subagent-convos.js:22`). Nesting works at any depth — a grandchild's `parent_convo_id` is simply its parent-child's id. The design must not assume children are leaves.

## 3. Current web-client architecture (the seams we build on)

All paths under `src/journal/`. Verified against HEAD `ccca0fd`.

- **Data model** — `Conversation` (`types.ts:38-48`) has no parent field. `SnapshotResponse` (`types.ts:50-53`). `ClientState` (`types.ts:180-203`) is a single flat immutable store object holding `conversations: Conversation[]`, `selectedConversationId?`, `events: JournalEvent[]`, and single-valued ephemeral fields (`activity`, `sessionStatus`, `textStreams`, `toolStreams`).
- **Store** — `MatronJournalClient` (`client.ts`), a hand-rolled external store exposed via `useSyncExternalStore` (`components.tsx:1865`). All mutation flows through `patch()` (`client.ts:1375`). Convos persist in IndexedDB (`database.ts`, `conversations` object store keyPath `id`).
- **Ingestion** — live events → `handleJournal` → `database.applyJournal` (`database.ts:167-215`), which already special-cases `convo_meta` for `title` (`database.ts:190`) and mints new convo records via `emptyConversation` (`database.ts:36-48`). Bootstrap → `api.snapshot()` → `database.replaceWithSnapshot` (`database.ts:106-126`, spreads `...summary`). Then `refreshConversations` (`client.ts:1211`) re-reads the DB into state.
- **Selection** — `selectConversation(id)` (`client.ts:305`) sets `selectedConversationId`, clears `events`, sends `{ op: "viewing", convo_id: id }` over the socket (`client.ts:321`) so the server replays that convo's ephemeral status/streams, and loads history. `clearSelection()` (`client.ts:330`) returns to the list. `selectedConversation()` returns the selected convo record.
- **Main list** — `ConversationList` (`components.tsx:247`) derives its rows from a `useMemo` over `state.conversations` (search filter, `components.tsx:375`), then partitions pinned/active/archived; `renderConversation` rows call `client.selectConversation(id)`.
- **Main pane** — `SignedInApp` (`components.tsx:1788`) renders, for the selected convo, `<ChatHeader>` + `<Timeline>` + `<Composer>` (`components.tsx:1844-1846`). `ChatHeader` (`components.tsx:875`) already has a `mj_BackButton` → `clearSelection()` and reuses `state.sessionStatus` for model/context/usage.
- **Timeline** — `Timeline` (`components.tsx:1346`). A `useLayoutEffect` (`components.tsx:1387-1423`) unconditionally jumps to the bottom on new content; there is **no** user-scrolled-up detection and **no** jump-to-bottom button today.
- **Styling** — plain PostCSS, `journal.pcss` / `shell.pcss`, global `mj_*` (matron-journal) + `mx_*` (element-derived) classes. Reusable: `mj_ChatHeader`, `mj_HeaderTitleCluster`, `mj_ModelContextCluster`, `mj_BackButton`, `mj_HeaderMenu`.
- **Tests** — Jest + jsdom, `test/unit-tests/`, `pnpm test` (`--runInBand`).

## 4. Design

Four inline additions, all within `types.ts` / `database.ts` / `client.ts` / `components.tsx` / `journal.pcss` (no file splits):

### 4.1 Data model — carry `parent_convo_id`, set-once-immutable

Add to `Conversation` (`types.ts:38`):

```ts
export interface Conversation {
    // …existing fields…
    parent_convo_id?: string | null; // null/undefined = top-level; set once at child creation, immutable
}
```

`SnapshotResponse` needs no change — its `conversations` are `Conversation` objects, and `replaceWithSnapshot` already spreads `...summary`, so the field flows through to IndexedDB once the type carries it.

**Ingestion (`database.ts`):**

- `emptyConversation` (`database.ts:36`) initializes `parent_convo_id: null`.
- `applyJournal` `convo_meta` branch (`database.ts:190`): extract `parent_convo_id` from the payload and apply the **immutability rule** — set only when not already set; a later `convo_meta` lacking the field (or carrying null) must **not** clear a previously-set value:

  ```ts
  if (event.type === "convo_meta") {
      if (typeof event.payload.title === "string") conversation.title = event.payload.title;
      const incoming = event.payload.parent_convo_id;
      if (conversation.parent_convo_id == null && typeof incoming === "string" && incoming) {
          conversation.parent_convo_id = incoming;
      }
  }
  ```

  This mirrors the apple client's set-only-when-nil rule (JournalStore.swift:258-263, 346-348) and prevents a titleless meta from de-linking a child.

- `replaceWithSnapshot` (bootstrap, no cursor): snapshot is authoritative — take `summary.parent_convo_id` directly (the `...summary` spread already does this once the field is typed; add an explicit `parent_convo_id: summary.parent_convo_id ?? null` for clarity and to normalize `undefined`→`null`).

**IndexedDB compatibility:** the `conversations` store has keyPath `id` and stores whole objects (`database.ts:77-78`); a new optional field is backward-compatible — existing records lack it → `undefined` → treated as top-level. **No schema-version bump.**

### 4.2 Derivations — client-side, from `state.conversations`

Because all convos (parents and children) live in `state.conversations`, the parent→child relationships are derived, never stored separately (P2 — one source of truth). Add small pure exported helpers (co-located with the other convo helpers in `types.ts`, imported where needed — they are reused by both `ConversationList` and the parent/child panes):

```ts
export function isSubChat(c: Pick<Conversation, "parent_convo_id">): boolean {
    return c.parent_convo_id != null && c.parent_convo_id !== "";
}

// children of a given convo id, oldest-first (created_at ASC, id ASC tiebreak)
export function childrenOf(conversations: Conversation[], parentId: string): Conversation[] {
    return conversations
        .filter((c) => c.parent_convo_id === parentId)
        .sort((a, b) => a.created_at - b.created_at || (a.id < b.id ? -1 : a.id > b.id ? 1 : 0));
}

export function runningChildrenOf(conversations: Conversation[], parentId: string): Conversation[] {
    return childrenOf(conversations, parentId).filter((c) => c.session_state === "running");
}
```

Pure functions → unit-testable in isolation, and they keep derivation logic out of the render bodies (P12).

### 4.3 Main-list exclusion — children never appear as top-level rows

In `ConversationList`'s `conversations` `useMemo` (`components.tsx:375`), add a parent-exclusion filter so children never render as top-level rows (mirrors apple's `parent_convo_id IS NULL` list query, `JournalStore.swift:428-430`):

```ts
const conversations = useMemo(() => {
    return state.conversations
        .filter((c) => !isSubChat(c))
        .filter(/* existing search filter */);
}, [query, state.conversations]);
```

**Defense in depth (apple's `ChatSummary` doc rule):** the unread aggregations that scan `state.conversations` directly — `hasAnyFavorite` (`components.tsx:392`), `hasActiveUnread` (`components.tsx:399`) — must also exclude children so a child's (already server-suppressed) unread can never leak into a mark-all or badge. Guard each with `!isSubChat(c)`.

### 4.4 Running-subagent strip (parent pane)

New inline component `RunningSubagentStrip({ client, state })`, mounted in `SignedInApp` directly above `<Timeline>` (between `<ChatHeader>` and `<Timeline>`, `components.tsx:1844-1845`). It keys on the **selected** convo id (works whether the selected convo is a root or itself a child — nesting):

- `const running = runningChildrenOf(state.conversations, state.selectedConversationId)`.
- Renders nothing when `running.length === 0`.
- Otherwise a horizontal scroll row of capsule pills, one per running child: a small spinner (`mj_Spinner`, CSS-only) + `conversationTitle(child)`. Each pill is a `<button onClick={() => client.selectConversation(child.id)}>` (a11y label `Open subagent <title>`).

The strip is present for both root convos and children, so a child that itself spawned grandchildren shows its running grandchildren.

### 4.5 Read-only child viewer + mini-header + switcher

In `SignedInApp`, branch the selected-convo pane on `isSubChat(selectedConversation)`:

- **Header:** render a `SubChatHeader` instead of `ChatHeader`. It reuses the `mj_ChatHeader` chrome and `state.sessionStatus` (the server replays the child's status on `viewing`, so model/context/usage are the child's), plus:
  - **Back button** → returns to the **parent**: `client.selectConversation(child.parent_convo_id)` when the parent record exists in `state.conversations`, else `client.clearSelection()` (parent archived/absent fallback).
  - **State label** — `session_state === "running"` → spinner + "Running", else "Finished".
  - **Switcher** — rendered only when the child has **more than one sibling** (`childrenOf(conversations, parentId).length > 1`), matching apple's "siblings > 1" gate. A `mj_HeaderMenu`-style dropdown listing every sibling oldest-first, each a button with a glyph: check = current (disabled), filled dot = other running, hollow dot = finished; selecting → `client.selectConversation(sibling.id)`.
- **Composer:** **not rendered** for a child (read-only). Optionally a muted "Read-only — subagent transcript" hint in the composer's place. Dropping the composer also removes the drag-to-attach affordance for children, which is correct (you cannot post to a subagent transcript).
- **Timeline:** unchanged — reused as-is. The running-subagent strip (4.4) still mounts above it (grandchildren case).

The parent pane (root or a child-with-children being viewed as a parent) is unchanged except for the strip above the timeline.

### 4.6 Tail-follow + jump-to-bottom (Timeline)

Replace the unconditional jump-to-bottom with an explicit follow-state (P23), matching apple's model:

- State (component-local `useState`/`useRef`, not global store): `isFollowingTail` (default `true`).
- A pure decision helper `isNearBottom(scrollTop, scrollHeight, clientHeight, thresholdPx)` (exported, unit-tested; keeps the math out of the effect).
- A scroll handler on the message-panel node, throttled with `requestAnimationFrame` (P13): sets `isFollowingTail = isNearBottom(...)` — scrolling up disables follow, scrolling back to the bottom re-enables it.
- The existing `useLayoutEffect` (`components.tsx:1387`) jumps to bottom **only when `isFollowingTail`**. The history-prepend anchor branch and the convo-switch reset (which force-follow the new convo) are preserved — a convo switch sets `isFollowingTail = true`.
- Sending your own message force-re-enables follow (`isFollowingTail = true`) so your message scrolls into view.
- **Jump-to-bottom button** — a bottom-trailing overlay (`mj_JumpToBottom`, `↓`), shown **only when `!isFollowingTail`**. Click → set `isFollowingTail = true` and `node.scrollTop = node.scrollHeight` (targeted, not global smooth-scroll).

This is the same enhancement for root and child timelines (the child viewer reuses `Timeline`).

### 4.7 Styling

New `mj_*` classes in `journal.pcss` (no Tailwind): `mj_SubagentStrip`, `mj_SubagentPill`, `mj_Spinner`, `mj_SubChatHeader` (or reuse `mj_ChatHeader` + a `mj_SubChatState` label), `mj_SwitcherMenu` / reuse `mj_HeaderMenu`, `mj_JumpToBottom`. CSS-only spinner (no JS animation).

## 5. Non-goals (explicit)

- **Desktop split-view** (parent + child side-by-side) — rejected alternative B; a follow-up loop if parallel-subagent monitoring proves valuable. Its cost is real: the single-selected-convo store would have to hold two live convos (events/streams/status/activity keyed by convo_id + a second `viewing` op), and its gain is largely nullified by the blocking-Task execution pattern.
- **Inline tappable subtask markers** in the parent timeline — rejected alternative C; not wire-supported (the parent `🔀 Subtask` event carries no child id / `tool_use_id`). Needs a bridge change + Matronhq upstream proposal. File as a follow-up loop.
- **Splitting `components.tsx` / `client.ts`** — forbidden by the upstream-alignment constraint. All additions are inline.
- **Push notifications for children** — server already suppresses; no client work.

## 6. Error handling & edge cases

- **Immutability** — a `convo_meta` with null/absent `parent_convo_id` never clears a set value (§4.1). A snapshot at bootstrap is authoritative (fresh DB).
- **Parent absent** — child selected but parent record not in `state.conversations` (archived/pruned): back button falls back to `clearSelection()`; the switcher still works (siblings share the same `parent_convo_id`, independent of the parent record's presence).
- **Only child** — `childrenOf(...).length === 1`: switcher hidden; back + title only.
- **Running → finished while viewing** — `session_state` flips via `convo_meta`/snapshot; the parent's strip pill disappears and the child header label updates reactively from `state.conversations`. No manual refresh.
- **Nested subagents** — a child that has its own children shows its running grandchildren in the strip (the strip keys on the selected id, whatever its depth).
- **Empty title child** — `conversationTitle` already falls back to the convo id (`types.ts:222`); pills/switcher inherit that.
- **IndexedDB back-compat** — pre-existing stored convos lack the field → `undefined` → top-level. No migration.

## 7. Testing (Jest + jsdom, `test/unit-tests/`)

Pure-logic + component tests (jsdom); no live server needed.

1. **Data model / ingestion** — `applyJournal` sets `parent_convo_id` from `convo_meta` once; a later null/absent value does not clear it; `replaceWithSnapshot` carries the field; `emptyConversation` defaults `null`.
2. **Derivation helpers** — `isSubChat`, `childrenOf` (ordering: created_at ASC, id tiebreak), `runningChildrenOf` (running-only) with fixtures including nested + finished children.
3. **List exclusion** — `ConversationList` renders no child rows; a child's unread does not surface in `hasActiveUnread` / mark-all.
4. **RunningSubagentStrip** — renders one pill per running child, none when zero; click calls `selectConversation(childId)`; nested case (viewing a child shows its running grandchildren).
5. **Child viewer** — for a child: `SubChatHeader` present, `Composer` absent; back button targets the parent (and falls back to `clearSelection` when parent absent); switcher visible only when siblings > 1 and lists siblings with correct current/running/finished glyphs; selecting a sibling calls `selectConversation`.
6. **Tail-follow** — `isNearBottom` pure helper (threshold boundaries); jump-to-bottom button hidden when following, shown when not; clicking re-enables follow; convo switch and own-send force follow. Regression: non-child timeline still tails as before.

## 8. Implementation steps

Ordered for TDD (test-first per step); each step is self-contained and leaves the app green.

- **T1 — Data model + ingestion.** Add `parent_convo_id?` to `Conversation` (`types.ts:38`); default it in `emptyConversation` (`database.ts:36`); apply the set-once rule in `applyJournal` `convo_meta` (`database.ts:190`); normalize in `replaceWithSnapshot` (`database.ts:106`). Tests per §7.1.
- **T2 — Derivation helpers.** Add `isSubChat` / `childrenOf` / `runningChildrenOf` to `types.ts`. Tests per §7.2.
- **T3 — Main-list exclusion + unread guards.** Filter children from `ConversationList` `useMemo` (`components.tsx:375`) and from `hasAnyFavorite` / `hasActiveUnread` aggregations. Tests per §7.3.
- **T4 — Running-subagent strip.** Inline `RunningSubagentStrip`; mount above `<Timeline>` in `SignedInApp` (`components.tsx:1845`). Tests per §7.4.
- **T5 — Read-only child viewer + mini-header.** Branch `SignedInApp` on `isSubChat(selectedConversation)`: `SubChatHeader` (back-to-parent, running/done label) replaces `ChatHeader`; omit `Composer`. Tests per §7.5 (back semantics, composer absence).
- **T6 — Switcher.** Sibling dropdown in `SubChatHeader`, gated on siblings > 1, with current/running/finished glyphs → `selectConversation`. Tests per §7.5 (switcher).
- **T7 — Tail-follow + jump-to-bottom.** Extract `isNearBottom` pure helper; add follow-state + rAF-throttled scroll handler + gated `useLayoutEffect` + `mj_JumpToBottom` button in `Timeline`. Tests per §7.6.
- **T8 — Styling.** `mj_*` classes in `journal.pcss` for strip, pills, spinner, sub-chat header/state, switcher, jump-to-bottom.
- **T9 — Verify + deploy.** `pnpm lint && pnpm test`; build (`corepack pnpm build`); manual check against the live journal server (spawn a session, run a subagent, confirm: child hidden from list, pill appears while running, tapping opens read-only child, switcher across parallel subagents, back returns to parent, jump-to-bottom works). Follow the atomic web deploy runbook (backup `webapp`, build in place, verify 8443, restore-on-fail). File follow-up loops for split-view (B) and inline markers / bridge wire-gap (C).

## 9. Acceptance criteria

- `Conversation` carries `parent_convo_id`; it is parsed from both `/snapshot` and live `convo_meta`, and is immutable once set (a null/absent later value never clears it). ✔ §4.1, T1, §7.1
- Subagent child convos never appear as top-level rows in the conversation list, and never contribute to unread/favorite aggregations. ✔ §4.3, T3, §7.3
- When a selected convo has running children, a pill strip above its timeline shows one spinning pill per running child; tapping a pill opens that child. Works at any nesting depth. ✔ §4.4, T4, §7.4
- Opening a child shows a **read-only** viewer: full timeline, no composer, a mini-header with the child title, running/finished state, model/context (child's), a back control that returns to the parent (falling back to the list if the parent is gone), and — when the child has >1 sibling — a switcher listing all siblings with current/running/finished glyphs. ✔ §4.5, T5-T6, §7.5
- The timeline tails new content by default, stops tailing when the user scrolls up, shows a jump-to-bottom button while not tailing, and re-enables tailing on jump-to-bottom, on own-send, and on convo switch. Non-child timelines behave as before. ✔ §4.6, T7, §7.6
- No new server or bridge dependency; no IndexedDB schema-version bump; `components.tsx` and `client.ts` are not split. ✔ §2, §4.1, constraint
- `pnpm lint && pnpm test` green; the feature verified manually against the live journal server. ✔ T9
